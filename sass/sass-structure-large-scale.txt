As you can see each sub-project has it's own primary stylesheet, modules, partials, and base. Vendored stylesheets are typically versioned and have their own top-level directory. This is a handy pattern to use on very large Sass projects.

|-- admin/           # Admin sub-project
|   |-- modules/
|   |-- partials/
|   `-- _base.scss

|-- account/         # Account sub-project
|   |-- modules/
|   |-- partials/
|   `-- _base.scss
|
|-- site/            # Site sub-project
|   |-- modules/
|   |-- partials/
|   `-- _base.scss
|
|-- vendor/          # CSS or Sass from other projects
|   |-- _colorpicker-1.1.scss
|   |-- _jquery.ui.core-1.9.1.scss
|   ...
|
|-- admin.scss       # Primary stylesheets for each project
|-- account.scss
`-- site.scss
